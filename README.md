# Xylophone 🎹

## My Goal

Learning how to use open source Flutter packages. By the end of this module, I should be comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.


## Description of app

A music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.
